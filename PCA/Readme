How to use the PCA code
--------------------------
There are two python files. pca_public is the main file that you want to run to perform the PCA. pca_functions contains
a bunch of functions called by the mail file. 

Before running the main file, you will need to change a few settings that appear at the top of pca_public:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bkgcorr: True if you have background files, False if you do not. 
dir_stem: The directory where your spectral files are located. They should be inside another folder within this directory,
    named for the timestep chosen when the program is run (see timestep below).
file_stem: A stem that identifies your spectral files, for example *src* for files containing the string "src".
output_stem: The directory where the results are placed. This includes spectra and light curves for the principal 
    components as well as the log-eigenvalue data (the variance each component accounts for).
rmf_path: The full file name of your rmf.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With those settings chosen, run the program. You will be prompted for three numbers:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enter timestep: The length of each spectrum in seconds, default 10000. This doesn't really matter, in the sense that 
    it isn't factored into the actual PCA math or results. It's just a way to organize the files that was useful for M. Parker 
    (the guy who wrote this code) when he was doing his original work on PCA, which used spectra of uniform 10000s length. If
    your spectra are all longer than 10000s and all different lengths, it won't matter, the PCA will still use the entire spectrum.
    All that matters is that the code will look for your files inside "dir_stem/10000s" if you enter 10000, and so on. So my 
    files are inside "dir_stem" in a folder called "10000s". If this bugs you, feel free to change how the code looks for your
    files. I was too scared of breaking something to change much.
Enter number of component spectra to plot: Default three. The number of principal components that will be plotted at the end. 
    This is also the number of components that will be saved as output at the end, so even if you plan on making your own plots, 
    if you want more than 3 PCs, enter the number here. 
Enter desired number of bins: Default 50. The number of energy bins used for plotting. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After that, you're good to go, with one warning: For the most part, pca_functions is safe to ignore, but if you're using 
background correction, the way it finds your background files is weird. On line 233 of pca_functions, you'll see this:

    backfile = specfile.replace('_src_' ,'_bg_')

Which means it identifies background files by taking the name of the source files and swapping the string "_src_" with "_bg_".
If your background files are not named like this, the code can't find them. You can change this line if you want to use a 
different naming convention, but make sure the string you use to identify your files doesn't appear elsewhere in the full 
filepath, or you'll get an error (for example, it used to say replace('sc' ,'bg') and gave me errors because the filepath contained
disc21, and it was looking for background files in dibg21).
